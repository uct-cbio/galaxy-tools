Enrichment Browser enables the user explore aggregated results of set and graph enrichment in an extended fashion. The combination of results yields an enhanced confidence in and an advandced understanding of particular regulation processes. The visualization of highlighted submodules and the interactive browsing of these results leads into a new generation of biological pathway analysis.
